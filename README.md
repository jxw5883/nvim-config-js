# nvim-config-js
Yet another nvim config for js/react native development. I took these configs from a medium guide and if I ever do find the guide again, I'll link them here.

## Features

- 2 space tabs
- html + css syntax highlighting
- React support

## Installation

Clone this repo and rename it to `~/.config/nvim`. Then initialize the submodule. (My config depends on https://github.com/jiangmiao/auto-pairs).

```
git submodule init --update
```
